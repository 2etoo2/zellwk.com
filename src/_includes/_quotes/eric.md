<blockquote>
I've been writing software for 20 years, long enough to know that getting expert, thorough and well written help on new topics was hopeless. People like Zell, who go out and become experts, then work hard to teach others like me are the reason software is easier fun to write these days. I'd gladly pay for the excellent content that Zell produces â€“ It's so much more efficient to learn from experts like him.
