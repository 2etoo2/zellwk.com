  I'm glad you want to hear more from me!

  If you want to subscribe to my articles via RSS, please paste [this link](/feed.xml) in your RSS reader app.

  Note: My videos *won't show up* in your RSS feed if you used the link above. (Had problems configuring RSS with Youtube. Send help if you know how to!).

  If you want a feed of my videos, paste [this link](https://www.youtube.com/zellwk) instead.

  **Note: I open up enrollment to my courses via email only**. You might want to [subscribe via email](/newsletter) if you don't want to miss out on course announcements!
