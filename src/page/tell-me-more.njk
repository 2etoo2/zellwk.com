<h1>Welcome to Frontend Wednesday!</h1>

{% markdown %}
I'm super duper excited to see you've decided to join Frontend Wednesday! Make sure you check your inbox in a few minutes. I sent you something sweet. ðŸ˜‰

For now, I'd love to help you figure out what to do/learn next to become a better frontend developer. Would you take an extra 3 minutes and tell me about yourself? I read every email.

(Please fill in as much details as possible. You'll get much better replies from me if you give me more information about yourself. And I'd love to help, so please don't feel shy!).
