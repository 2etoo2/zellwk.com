## Main projects

1. Writing [Learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.today) â€” my flagship course on JavaScript. You'll understand JavaScript and learn to build anything from scratch with it after going through this course.

## Side projects

I have many thoughts about what side project to pursue, but I haven't decided on one yet. I might, soon.
